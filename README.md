# VBREG
Vector-Based REG v1.0

The VB-REG model is origionally developed within C# (which is developed as a compoent of a big project). 

The evaluation outcomes in the paper "Statistical NLG for Generating the Content and Form of Referring Expressions" is based on the C# version.

For this repository, the VB-REG model is rewriten as an indipendent project (with python 3.6.5 and numpy 1.14.3), but only few tests were done on the python edition.

For any question or bugs reporting, please email me (xiao[dot]li [at] abdn[dot]ac[dot]uk).
